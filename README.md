# Optimism NFT Minter
## https://optimism.decent.xyz/
This is a Python script for minting NFTs on the Optimism network. It reads private keys from a file and uses them to mint NFTs.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Python 3.9 or higher.
3. Install the required packages with ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

### Usage
- Create a file named wallets.txt and add private keys, one per line.
- Run the script with ``` opti_world_mint.py ```

#### Notes
The script currently uses the Optimism network with the RPC endpoint provided by Ankr. If you want to use a different network or endpoint, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
The script uses the web3 library for interacting with the Ethereum network. Make sure to keep your web3 version up-to-date to avoid potential security vulnerabilities.
